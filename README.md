#### Instructions:

1. Use the global hotkey Ctrl+Win+Alt+V to decrypt the current clipboard and rewrite it.
2. If the Ctrl+V hook is disabled, Ctrl+Win+Alt+V will simulate a Ctrl+V call, meaning Ctrl+Win+Alt+V will decrypt and paste.
3. If the Ctrl+V hook is enabled, simply press Ctrl+V to decrypt and paste, with global effect.

enjoy!
